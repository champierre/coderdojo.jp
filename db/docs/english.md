## ‚òØÔ∏è What is CoderDojo? {#about}

[CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/en/about) is the community of free, volunteer-led, community-based computer clubs for kids and teens. Since the first dojo took place in [Cork, Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)) in 2011, it gradually spreads out all over the world. And it is now over 100 countries, including Japan. üóæ

## üóæ CoderDojo in Japan {#japan}

In the early days of CoderDojo, when its size was less than 10 countries and 100 dojos, the first dojo was born in [OpenSource Cafe](https://medium.com/opensource-cafe) in 2012.

With the grow of CoderDojo community in Japan, demands from companies to support the community are also increased. To meet the demands, with [the approval of CoderDojo Foundation](/docs/regional-license_en), we founded the CoderDojo Japan Association in 2016.

Since incorporated, as one of [official national partners](https://coderdojo.com/en/partner-network), we continue building good relationship with corporate partners, and there are now 25 partners including [The Pok√©mon Foundation](https://www.pokemon-foundation.or.jp/news/5/).
